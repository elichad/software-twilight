# Solution

A short (~5 minutes) questionnaire that leads to a badge for your README indicating your maintenance/end-of-life plans.
This should be a minimal amount of work to encourage people to consider maintenance without becoming overwhelmed by the options

## Questions include:
* How much maintenance do you want to do? None/a tiny bit/a lot/etc.
* Do you have funding for maintenance?
* Have you identified funding opportunities for further maintenance?
* How long do you intend to maintain for?
* Will you continue maintenance after funding runs out?
* Who is the contact person at the end of the project?
* Do you expect to ever come back to this project for further development? I.e. is this a development gap, not end-of-life
* Do you welcome new development from other people? Are you able to answer questions/open to being contacted?
* Do you support/help track forks for new development?
